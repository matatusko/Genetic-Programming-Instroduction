# Introduction to Genetic Programming

Ok, maybe introduction is a slightly misleading name, but I'm going through different tutorials and exercises on genetic programming 
and dropping all the notebooks here. Some people might find it useful - if you're a pro with GP then don't even bother - for a while
it will only contain some simple stuff with explanations, mostly written for me. Just thought some people would enjoy it as well :)

# List of notebooks

Here I'll list all the notebooks and the relevant information to each single one, including a brief description of a project and what inspired me to write that code in particular.

## 1 - String Reproduction

Use genetic programming to recreate a given string. Code heavily inspired by the [first tutorial](https://blog.sicara.com/getting-started-genetic-algorithms-python-tutorial-81ffa1dd72f9) on GP I've went through by Louis Nicolle. Really well written so I would highly recommend having a read. I've editted a couple of thing here and there, but mostly is the same thing.
